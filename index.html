<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>I couldn’t find reference to this particular problem anywhere (except from a programmer of the month competition in 1995). This is very similar to solving a crossword however there are some differences. There isn’t a great deal of good source code floating around.</p>

<p>Note: The following is meant to provide insight into the problem that is crossword solving algorithm.
Note: The following is based on a game called a Crozzle. The rules for the game Crozzle can be googled to be understood.
Note: Specific conditions apply to this solution please refer to the rules.</p>

<p>Here I am not going to provide any mathematical notation or even a proof that I based my approach on, because I didn’t have one!
The solution presented here was not the one I finally came up with, it is simple and stripped down for maximum readability and is intended to be easily understandable. It still however generates a good solution that can be easily adapted and expanded. 
The purpose here is to give you in laymen's terms a means to approach the problem with logic and give you a good starting point to create your solution. Do not however get lazy and JUST use this code I went to the trouble of putting this page together because I want you to find a BETTER solution!</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid of scrapping all of your code and starting from scratch here this problem has no best solution (will explain this later) and your probably not going to come up with it. 
Instead get the best solution you can dream up and the best way to do that is to build off others work!</p>

<p>Anyway, here’s a Crozzle solution.</p>

<h3>
<a id="the-problem" class="anchor" href="#the-problem" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Problem</h3>

<p>Ok so first to get started, there is no real best approach to this problem. You might be thinking what do you mean theres no best solution? Well this particular problem is a NP-Hard problem. Google NP-Hard (some work is involved here).
 Now on first glance, obviously the only way to ensure we have the best possible solution is to check every possible combination. That’s how we know were right we try everything, RIGHT?</p>

<p>WRONG!</p>

<p>If you aren’t aware yet Ill burst your bubble. You CANT use brute force! 
As this problem scales there are simply to many options to check (Google around if you don’t believe me!).
So now that we’ve established brute force is out the window we need to come up with some solid heuristics!</p>

<p>What are heuristics? You might be asking. A computing definition defines it as "proceeding to a solution by trial and error or by rules that are only loosely defined." 
Simply put, pick some rules that increase the likelihood of a good scoring Crozzle!
What rules you might be thinking? Well try making them up!
That’s it make some assumptions about the problem and try them!</p>

<p>Keep in mind the heuristics you come up with apply to the rules and constraints of your game, here’s some food for thought.
• Words with the most common occurring characters.
• Long words (if you’re trying to maximize intersections).
• Starting with a short word.
• Starting with a long word.</p>

<p>Simple list but you get the point.</p>

<p>All im trying to illustrate here is that you through trial and error have to gradually improve your solution, which all starts with something you make up right now!</p>

<h3>
<a id="rules" class="anchor" href="#rules" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rules</h3>

<ol>
<li>A horizontal word must intersect 1 or 2 vertical words.</li>
<li>A vertical word must intersect 1 or 2 horizontal words. </li>
<li>One point for each letter within the Crozzle. </li>
<li>A horizontal word cannot touch any other horizontal word. Meaning there must be at least one grid space between a horizontal word and any other horizontal word.</li>
<li>A vertical word cannot touch any other vertical word. That is, there must be at least one grid space between a vertical word and any other vertical word.<br>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<a id="conclusion" class="anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conclusion</h3>

<p>You should focus on playing around with the (methodology) of generation. The “word checking methods” within the CrozzleGrid class are completely portable and can be re-used allowing you a lot more time to focus on your solution!</p>

<p>Happy Coding!</p>
